ℹ️ SmartEditor is a series of rich text editor component commonly used in web &amp; mobile services from Naver.

A short project about the architectural pattern for mobile applications.

**Graduate Research Intern,** Mar 2017 – Jun 2017.<br />
**Theory and Formal Methods Lab.,** **Korea University,** Rep. of Korea.

TA for Theory of Computation (undergrad subject), Spring 2017.

Also did continue VERSA maintenance (described below).

**Computer Rm Officer (Military Automation Systems Operator),** Jul 2014 – Jan 2016.<br />
in duty Apr 2014 – do.

During an achievement of legal duty in Rep. of Korea, I did these in army:

- Analysis and reestablishment of network topology and security policy for military networks, including ~ 2k terminals (i.e. PCs) and &gt; 100 equipments (i.e. routers).
- Saved annual +40% loss (by estimate) off from computer room supplies, inventing a critical control point system over the lifecycle of them.

**Undergraduate Research Intern,** Sep 2013 – Apr 2014.<br />
**Theory and Formal Methods Lab., Korea University,** Rep. of Korea.

ℹ️ ACSR is a process algebraic formal specification language, like CCS (Milner, R.) or CSP (Hoare, C. A. R.).

With VERSA ([🔗](<https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/duncan/versa.html>)), the toolset for ACSR, I did these:

- Recovered the sane executable build from unmaintained source including usage of super old LEDA graph library. (*Currently* the build is still producible.)
- Source code refactoring up to C++17 from old C++99, with many bugfixes over the ACSR theories.
- Adaptation of new concurrency theories, such as one in hypervisor universe.

**Service Engineer Intern**, Jan 2013 – Aug 2013; 2 mths.<br />
DX team of Mabinogi ([🔗](<http://mabinogi.nexon.com/>)), **Nexon Korea Corp.**, Rep. of Korea.

ℹ️ Mabinogi is an online desktop RPG having &gt; 10 yo.

Mabinogi Talk (Android [🔗](<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexon.mabinogi.messenger>)), mobile IM app integrated with Mabinogi's in-game chat service.

Mabinogi Master of Living (*currently* EOL; Android [🔗](<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexon.MasterOfLiving>), iOS [⛓️](<https://apps.apple.com/app/id668500500>)), a mobile spinoff minigame from Mabinogi.

- Made an on-demand assets system for Mabinogi MoL (launched for Android: Jan 2013), integrated with the Unity Editor (Mabinogi MoL was made on Unity 4). It resulted in major reduction of the base app artifact size from ~ 180 MB to &lt; 30 MB, then also enabling service launch for iOS later (Nov 2013). It took 2 wks to make an early days implementation.

## Contest & Conference

**2021**

*Walkthrough of an Android Programmer on Server-side Engineering: Progressive Release and Compatibility Organizing for CLOVA App.* DEVIEW 2021. ([🔗](<https://deview.kr/2021/sessions/418?lang=en>) DEVIEW is a software developer conference)

> This session is performed in Korean.
>
> "CLOVA App" is the sole GUI for enduser of "CLOVA", our voice-oriented virtual assistant service, which accordingly provides essential controls and scope of management. Can you guess what turns to be the major problem of an app client, when it should be all aware of other speaker clients and skill microservices—because the service platform is basically the mediator between them?
>
> We introduce some internals–how a mini server-side engineering topic is eventually extended from a person, who are actually an Android programmer. The material contains 2 years of trials (also errors,) that is composed of half a year of working prototypes; another of pratical substantiation including UX+QA topics; and the production use of a year and going on. We wish this could bring you some nit tips and empathy as a developer, like you, like a salmon tracing up the river living in fast-fast world of service softwares.
