During an achievement of legal duty in Rep. of Korea, I did these in army:

- Analysis and reestablishment of network topology and security policy for military networks, including ~ 2k terminals (i.e. PCs) and &gt; 100 equipments (i.e. routers).
- Saved annual +40% loss (by estimate) off from computer room supplies, inventing a critical control point system over the lifecycle of them.

**Undergraduate Research Intern,** Sep 2013 – Apr 2014.
**Theory and Formal Methods Lab., Korea University,** Rep. of Korea.

With VERSA ([🔗](<https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/duncan/versa.html>)), the toolset for ACSR, I did these:

- Recovered the sane executable build from unmaintained source including usage of super old LEDA graph library. (*Currently* the build is still producible.)
- Source code refactoring up to C++17 from old C++99, with many bugfixes over the ACSR theories.
- Adaptation of new concurrency theories, such as one in hypervisor universe.

- Made an on-demand assets system for Mabinogi MoL (launched for Android: Jan 2013), integrated with the Unity Editor (Mabinogi MoL was made on Unity 4). It resulted in major reduction of the base app artifact size from ~ 180 MB to &lt; 30 MB, then also enabling service launch for iOS later (Nov 2013). It took 2 wks to make an early days implementation.
